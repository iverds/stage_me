== Stage Me

The idea is a simple app that recieves http-post from github after a push.
It should provide a simple interface to different applications, and deploy them to a staging area. This could be usefull when there are multiple applications that depend on each other.


Following features could be provided:

- Run tests
- Link to documentation of appliaction
- Deploy to staging area
- Update sql-views between applications
- Show a UI for both tests and doc
